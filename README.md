# hyperopt-llm-project
LM-AutoOpt is a few-shot hyperparameter optimization framework that uses LLM reasoning to propose optimal configurations for time-series forecasting models. It improves interpretability and iteratively enhances model understanding using meta-knowledge from key stages of the model development pipeline.
